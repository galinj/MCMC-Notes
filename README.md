# Fundamentals of Markov Chain Monte Carlo

The first goal is to write up notes from MCMC topics course.  The second goal is to see if it can be turned into a sensible book.  The intendend audience consists of researchers bew to MCMC theory (as opposed to Markov chain theory), for example, third-year PhD students.
