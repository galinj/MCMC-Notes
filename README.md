# Markov Chain Monte Carlo Course Notes

The goal is to write up notes from a Markov chain Monte Carlo course I've taught on a few occasions.  The intended audience consists of researchers new to MCMC theory and methods.  The foundations of MCMC will be emphasized, not necessarily the most cutting edge research methods and algorithms, at least at first.   Updates will be irregular and all files should be considered drafts that may change substantially.
